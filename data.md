Synthesis activities conducted with RCN funds may generate new data in the form of simulations or metaanalyses. 
To be complient with our NSF grant, these data must be archived in a compliant manner.

To achieve longer-term storage and open access after publication, data products will undergo final quality control checks 
and then will be archived either through online repositories such as BCO-DMO (https://bco-dmo.org) and other repositories on 
the list of [OCE Approved Data and Sample Repositories](https://www.nsf.gov/geo/oce/oce-data-sample-repository-list.jsp).

BCO-DMO stands for Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office

## First, please read these OCE Data Sharing resources:
* OCE Sample and Data Policy https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2017/nsf17037/nsf17037.jsp
* OCE Approved Data and Sample Repositories https://www.nsf.gov/geo/oce/oce-data-sample-repository-list.jsp
  *  Note that generalist archives like Dryad and FigShare are _not_ approved repositories. 
  *   Github itself is not an archive and anything posted there can be taken down at any time.   
Please refer to the [code, models, and software page](https://www.bco-dmo.org/page/submitting-code-software-and-models) for more about either getting a DOI for your github repository in a long-term archive (e.g. Zenodo) or contributing code to BCO-DMO to curate.  That page also explains the level of documentation required whether the code sits with BCO-DMO or Zenodo.
  *  The repositories listed in the link provide domain-specific data curation, long-term archiving, and metadata and quality standards that ensure data are reusable and understandable. 

## Prepare your data for archive in BCO-DMO
* For more information about the data serving process at BCO-DMO and our metadata forms please consult their [How to page](https://www.bco-dmo.org/how-get-started)
* Here is an example of what a Dataset Metadata Page looks like at BCO-DMO: "Pore water Geochemistry": https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/813166
* They typically serve data in the order they are received and our submission queue can sometimes be weeks to months long.    Please take this into account when planning your dataset submissions in the future.
* You can email them at info@bco-dmo.org.  If you think it would be helpful, they will set up a Zoom together to hash out a data submission plan together.
