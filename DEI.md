title: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
---


The Research Coordinated Network for Evolution in Changing Seas is dedicated to promoting collaboration, networking, and the exchange of knowledge. We welcome and encourage participation by all individuals, regardless of age, culture, race, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, national origin, physical or mental disability, politics, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, or subculture. We strive to cultivate a network built on encouragement, acceptance, and mutual respect, thereby engendering a welcoming environment for all. We believe that innovation arises from diversity in terms of ideas and membership. We will vigorously and proactively reject prejudice and stereotyping whenever it is encountered in our profession, be it racism, xenophobia, religious discrimination, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or any other form. We further promote diversity and equity through the development of an inclusive and supportive environment, and by fostering a focus on diversity in membership, leadership, committees, outreach, public engagement, recruitment, and in all other areas of activity within the network.

# Diversity Committee

Our [Diversity Committee](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/steering/) meets on a regular basis to advance initiatives and discuss diversity.

# Diversity Initiatives

We have advanced diversity and inclusion in our network through the following initiatives:

- **Open Network** - Anyone can become a member of our RCN - [Apply here](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/howtojoin/)
- **Virtual Lab Meeting Training Program** - We invented this program during the pandemic to match junior trainees (undergrad/grad) with labs whose research matched their interests. Trainees attend lab meetings virtually and receive a $500 paid stipend for their contribution to the lab. We ran the program in 2020 and 2021, and this year the program is being run through SMBE. We have survey data that indicates the program was a huge success. Almost 80 junior academics have been trained through our program!
- **Coordinated Readings** - Every spring semester we have a series of [coordinated readings](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/coord_readings/) that we discuss on Slack. Hundreds of academics from labs around the world have participated in discussions together. We started doing "diversity checks" on the list of readings to ensure that the were not dominated by authors from one particular group.
- **Junior Professional Development Exchanges** We have funded almost 20 professional development exchanges for trainees to learn a new technique, write a grant, or expand their network.
- **Open Applications for Workshops** We invite everyone to apply to our workshops.
- **Open Applications for Working Groups from Postdocs** In 2021 we invited working group proposals led by postdocs, which gave them opportunity to take a leadership role in the network. Check out our [list of working groups](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/WorkingGroups/)
- **Paid Stipends to Junior Trainees** All junior trainees conducting synthesis activities on working groups are eligible to apply for stipends for their work and we have minimum stipend rates.
