# Virtual Lab Meeting Training Program

The Diversity Committee wanted to set up a program that would increase diversity in our network and create new connections among network members without taking up anyone’s time. We came up with the Virtual Lab Meeting Training Program. This program matched junior academics with labs. The junior person could earn a $500 stipend for attending 10 lab meetings and leading discussions for part of at least 2 lab meetings.

We have a lot of data that indicates that the Virtual Lab Meeting Training Program was extremely successful at training junior academics, increasing diversity of our network, and bringing a new perspective to established labs. We hope to publish this data. A few things to note: many participants said that the stipend was important to them for making the time to finish the program. Survey respondents who rated the program lower noted that they weren’t matched with a lab who shared their interests. On the other hand, some survey respondents who were matched with a lab that they didn’t request said that they benefitted greatly from the program and it helped to accelerate their research.

Check out the amazing group of [RCN Trainees](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/trainees/) who have participated in this program or other working group activities. We created this page for them to help raise their profile in the field.
