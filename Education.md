title: Educational Resources from RCN Labs

Please help us build this page of educational resources for teaching at the intersection of marine and evolutionary science. We are particularly interested in teaching materials that feature or highlight research being done by people from diverse backgrounds.

# Elementary School (Grades K-6)

* [Preschool Shell Matching Game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/187FM1rcU3AzVy5tydwwgzEfvBmVZODPr/view)


# Middle School (Grades 6-8)



# High School Students (Grades 9-12)

* [This webpage put together by the Lotterhos Lab contains activities for teaching evolution and marine science](https://drk-lo.github.io/EvolutionWorkshop/), including:
  *  Non-genetic inheritance
  *  Effects of ocean acidification on marine calcifiers
  *  Seagrass wasting disease
  *  Modeling the Dynamic Oyster Microbiome (*Highlights research by a Latina*)
  *  Using SliM to understand and simulate evolution
  *  Curriculum for a 6-session "Learn to Code" workshop (1.5 hours per session)

# Undergraduate Level

* [Paper strip activities for understanding F-statistics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u0tSy5OgepJoFeZ_cHUEemCfQC79dAMIOZsJExDYGEo/edit) For undergraduate and graduate students in learning population and conservation genetics. F-statistics convey important information about the genetic structure of populations. But what do they mean? This learning module teaches F-statistics in a backwards way than normally taught. Instead of giving students data and having them calculate the F-statistics, we give students the F-statistics and challenge them to build the populations that would have those statistics.


# Graduate Level or Upper Level Undergraduate

* [A List of R Shiny Apps for Population and Ecological Genetics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lVqBRe0A9SO0ycIJc0RiI5xqHu28FF8xcNgL4rzQED8/edit)
* [The webpage of the Temporal Genomics working group](https://tempgenomics-rcn.github.io/website/)
  * You-tube recordings of 2021 seminar series and other resources
* [The webpage for the marine-omics working group](https://marineomics.github.io/)
  * Recordings of panel discussions on genomic data analysis and other resources
* [The webpages for Kelp and Urchin Genomics as a Gateway to Bioinformatics: Teaching Materials]
* Marine Genomics and Bioinformatics Course
 * We have two versions of the Marine Genomics course available for use by the community and have made the materials accessible to both instructors as well as students. One version covers a [semester (15 weeks) worth of material](https://baylab.github.io/MarineGenomicsSemester/) and the other covers a [quarter (10 weeks) of material](https://baylab.github.io/MarineGenomics/)
