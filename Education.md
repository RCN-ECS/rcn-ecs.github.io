Please help us build this page of educational resources for teaching at the intersection of marine and evolutionary science. We are particularly interested in teaching materials that feature or highlight research being done by people from diverse backgrounds.

# Elementary School (K-6)

Currently we do not have resources for this age group

# Middle School (grades 6-8)

Currently we do not have resources for this age group

# High School Students (grades 9-12)

* [This webpage put together by the Lotterhos Lab contains activities for teaching evolution and marine science](https://drk-lo.github.io/EvolutionWorkshop/), including:
  *  Non-genetic inheritance
  *  Effects of ocean acidification on marine calcifiers
  *  Seagrass wasting disease
  *  Modeling the Dynamic Oyster Microbiome (*Highlights research by a Latina*)
