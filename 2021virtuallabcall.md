title: 2021 Virtual Lab Meeting Training Program
---

The Research Coordinated Network (RCN) for Evolution in Changing Seas seeks to bring together marine scientists with evolutionary biologists to further our understanding of adaptation in the ocean. The RCN is excited to announce a that we will be running the Virtual Lab Meeting Training Program for a second year! For data and quotes from last year's participants, [check out this blog post](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/2021-08-08-VirtualLabMeetingProgramResults/) and the [diverse list of last year's mentees](https://github.com/RCN-ECS/rcn-ecs.github.io/blob/master/VLMTPmentees.md). This program helps mentees develop a supportive network, provides a pathway for mentees to future success, and broadens their knowledge in our field. Since all lab meetings 
are virtual during COVID, this is an excellent time to take advantage of these unusual circumstances with a training program.

In this program, the RCN seeks to provide training to students at the undergraduate or graduate level ("mentees")
by participating in lab meetings of a research group that shares their interests. The mentee will participate by attending
lab meetings during 2021-2022.
A designated "mentor" from the research group will dedicate portions of two lab meetings 
to the mentee's professional development. The format for lab meetings dedicated to the mentee's professional development is flexible, but
could take the form of review of graduate school or grant application statements at lab meeting, 
research presentation at lab meeting, lead paper discussion at lab meeting, etc.

### The following are requirements for program completion:
- Attendence at 10 lab meetings with portions of 2 lab meetings dedicated to mentee's professional development before May 2022, 
- Monthly participation in professional development discussions in a Slack Channel

### Stipend
Approved applicants will receive a $500 stipend (see information on eligibility and number of stipends available below).

## Information for applicants

## Eligibility to apply

We welcome and encourage applications from all students at the undergraduate or graduate level, regardless of institution or nationality, age, culture, race, 
ethnicity, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, politics,

We aim to be able to place every applicant with a mentor. 

Note, however, that there are a limited number of stipends. In a recent RCN survey, 74% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that a proportion of stipends should be prioritized to increasing underrepresented groups within the RCN. This program is part of our [antiracism response to systematic racism in society](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/Antiracism/). Stipends will be priortized for:
* participants who did not previously partipate in last year's Virtual Lab Meeting Training Program
* individuals who best describe how their particiation in this program will help to increase diversity of underrepresented groups in our field.
